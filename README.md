# unit-4-game


A delicious game of feeding a cat stomach until it explodes! 

Ever wanted to be a slave of cuteness to a cat? Well this game gives you the opportunity to be a subject to a cat and feed her until her stomach is satisfied! 

-At the beginning of the game, the computer generates a random number between 19 and 120! The higher the number, the more food it takes to feed Butters the cat :)

-Each of the four foods at the bottom, the juicy bacom cheese burger, fried salmon tempura sushi, cilantro onion asada tacos, and the s'more's raspberry and whip cream pancake, each are generated a random value between 1-12, or the amount they will quench the kitties' hunger on click.

-After Butters is sufficiently satisfied, or her stomach explodes and she gets stitched back up, the game resets by randomizing Butters' hunger, and the four food's fullnes values. 

html is updated by using jquery $("target").text(variable);

Future Edits!
-Win condition, lose condition, and reset could be turned into on call functions and clean up code
-A way to update kitty image on win/loss, and when different foods are clicked
-Buttons randomly turn blue, unknown error???
